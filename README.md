## ðŸ’» Project summary

This repo does not have a user-friendly graphical interface, its proposal is just the functionality to generate the QR with the content that the user wanted, Next.js was used to generate new QR codes without the need to "load" the page taking advantage of server side rendering.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

Project was built using **Node.js** and **Next.js** and the following dependencies:

- **[QRcode SVG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-svg)** - This library has been written to generate a SVG image of QR Code in Node.js

## ðŸ“• How to use:

To use it, just run it locally and in the body of the link, pass the site or text you want to generate, as shown below:

```bash
